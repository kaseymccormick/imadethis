I've been crafting for many years and thus collected many tools to complete projects. And been able to easily obtain most supplies for crafts on demand. But sometimes it's very helpful to have a kit of supplies, while thinking of this blog I've also thought what would be in that kit. So far here is the base supplies, where to find them and the pricepoint I've been able to get them at.
