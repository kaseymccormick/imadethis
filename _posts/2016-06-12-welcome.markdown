It's taken some time but this small part of the internet is set aside to log and write about the things I create. These 'things' can involve edible creations, tactile (typically craft in nature) and non tactile creations (typically code driven).

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
